# ShadowBoxXY
A project to provide IR remote control to an individually addressable WS2812b LED strip that has been cut and soldered into an XY array for use in lighting a shadow box. Utilizes an Arduino as the controller.

Requires IRremote and FastLED Arduino libraries to run.

**Future Improvements: Rewrite all RGB values to HSV to have more advanced and accurate control of brightness.**
